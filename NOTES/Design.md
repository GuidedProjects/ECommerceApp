# RESTful API + C# Clean Architecture
- **ApiResponse<ConfirmationResponseDTO>**: when the API operation performs a write action (such as Create, Update, Delete) and you only need to confirm the result rather than return the full object data.
  - Common scenarios:
    - Creating a record but not returning full details.
    - Updating existing data.
    - Soft/hard deleting records.
    - Changing user credentials (e.g., password).
    - Performing other state-changing actions (e.g., activation/deactivation).
    
- **ApiResponse<T>**: when your API operation is intended to retrieve and return data to the client.
  - Common scenarios:
    - Fetching details of a single record by ID.
    - Returning a newly created object after a successful POST.
    - Returning a list of data (use ApiResponse<List<T>>).
    - Any read-only operation where the client needs the full or partial entity data.
